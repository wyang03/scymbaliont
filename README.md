Project Description
--------------------
The project explores two issues that constantly come up in various discourses for the topic of Anthropocene. First one, the concept of deep time, which describes the experience of multi-temporality (past, present and future at the same time), as well as the coexistence of different bio-time-scales of various organisms (slow, fast, etc.). The second idea concerns what Haraway called make kin, which places human among vast network of multispecies and seeks to approach Anthropocene from a more holistic perspectives, more or less resembling Bruno Latour’s Actor-network theory. 

The title of the project attempts to capture these ideas: symbiont (element within symbiosis), cymbal (the project’s inclusion of percussion/ist), al- and -ont (the former used as prefix denoting to in latin, therefore embodying some degree of future; the latter, meaning have in French, can be used to construct past participle, such as ils ont mangé - they have eaten, therefore preserve some sense of the past).

The project is essentially a performance environment with different actors exercising confluence over each other (shown below). The main actors are, from right to the left, the lights, the drummer, the screen, the dead plant, and the living plant. The light is cast from behind the drummer, who improvises and constantly moves, resulting in even-changing amount and location of light passing through the screen, which serves as the filter. The ldr sensor installed on the dead plant reads the filtered light and sends the data one the one hand to the Supercollider, which algorithmically generates music, on the other hand to the vibration motor installed on the living plant, which excites the chimes. The sum of these two sounds (the electronic and the analogue) generates the sound world (together with the acoustic environment) and influences the improvisation of the drummer. In addition, the ldr also sends the data to the lights behind at the rear, which will change their intensities and rotations accordingly. In another word, this is a feed-back network which constantly renews itself. The confluential relation among the network within this network addresses the concern of kin-making, while the deep time aspect is explored via the display of both dead and living plants (multi-temporalities), as well as the algorithmic technique within the supercollider (coexistence of various time scales).
